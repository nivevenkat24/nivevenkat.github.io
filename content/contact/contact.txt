title: Let's Connect
body: I'm always excited to connect with people working on innovative products, AI applications, and big strategic challenges.


I also enjoy supporting others on similar journeys. I regularly mentor students interested in engineering, product, AI, studying abroad, or navigating early-career decisions. I love helping early-stage startups brainstorm ideas, and I support mission-driven teams and NGOs whenever possible.

If you’d like to chat, explore mentorship, or simply brainstorm, I’d be happy to connect — I’m usually available on weekends.

Looking forward to what's ahead — and grateful that our paths have crossed.
