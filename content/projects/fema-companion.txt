overview: A specialized AI tool built to help engineers and designers quickly interpret FEMA P-750 and NIST GCR seismic design guidelines.
Using natural language queries, users can ask questions like "What are the criteria for Seismic Design Category D?" or "List response-modification factors for SMRFs," and instantly receive concise, cited explanations from the official design documents.
The goal: make seismic design knowledge accessible and searchable — transforming long, technical PDFs into a fast, intuitive, and interactive engineering companion.
Built with the power of ChatGPT, OpenAI embeddings, and a Streamlit UI, FEMA Companion bridges the gap between technical codes and real-time understanding.
stack:
- Data Source: FEMA P-750 and NIST GCR public design manuals (PDF → text extraction)
- Embedding & Indexing: OpenAI embeddings; stored and indexed locally in ChromaDB for fast vector retrieval
- Query Engine: OpenAI GPT interprets user questions, retrieves relevant text chunks, and generates concise, cited answers (e.g., [FEMA_P750.pdf p.12])
- User Interface: Streamlit app for free-form questions in plain English, contextual answers, and citation verification
- Architecture Layers: Data (extraction & cleaning) • Embedding (OpenAI) • Retrieval (Chroma) • Response (GPT) • UI (Streamlit)
focus:
- Accessibility – Converts static PDFs into an interactive, searchable knowledge base
- Accuracy – Provides answers directly cited from the original code sections
- Efficiency – Reduces time spent searching through manuals by over 80%
target_users:
- Structural engineers referencing FEMA/NIST design codes
- Civil engineers and design reviewers needing quick lookups
- Engineering students learning seismic design fundamentals
impact:
- Cuts reference lookup time from hours to seconds
- Encourages code compliance by improving access to source guidance
- Demonstrates practical AI integration for engineering knowledge systems
future:
- Add Ollama local model integration for fully offline use
- Include design examples and formula lookups for educational use
- Extend support to other design standards (ASCE 7-22, ACI 318, etc.)
- Enable multi-document RAG with versioned FEMA updates
